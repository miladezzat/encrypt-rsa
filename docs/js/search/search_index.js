\n\n\n\nChangelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nGenerating the changelog\n\nFrom commits (since last tag): npm run changelog — updates CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits (e.g. feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE:).\nFull release (bump version + changelog + tag): npm run release -- --release-as major|minor|patch — uses standard-version; bump and changelog are driven by commit messages.\n\n4.0.0 - 2025-02-01\nBREAKING CHANGES\n\nAsync API: All crypto methods now return Promises instead of synchronous values. Migrate by adding await or .then() to every call to:\nencryptStringWithRsaPublicKey\ndecryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey\nencrypt\ndecrypt\ncreatePrivateAndPublicKeys\nencryptBufferWithRsaPublicKey\ndecryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey\n\n\nEntry points: Package now ships separate Node and Web builds. main/module/types point to ./build/node/node/index.js; browser and conditional exports point to the Web build. The old single entry ./build/index.js is no longer published.\nBuffer return type: decryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey return type is now Promise (was Buffer). In Node the runtime value is still a Buffer; use Uint8Array in shared or cross-environment code.\n\nFeatures\n\nNode and Web builds: Same package works in Node.js and in the browser. Conditional exports select the correct build; same NodeRSA class and INodeRSA interface in both environments.\nWeb Crypto (browser): Browser build uses the Web Crypto API (RSA-OAEP, SHA-1) for encrypt/decrypt with public/private key and for key generation. encrypt(privateKey) / decrypt(publicKey) throw in the browser (not supported by Web Crypto).\nShared interface: Both builds implement the shared INodeRSA interface; buffer methods use Uint8Array in the type signature.\n\n3.3.0 (2024-10-12)\nFeatures\n\nindex.ts: add support for encrypt and decrypt buffer (065b843), closes

It supports Node.js and browser (web) with the same API. Generate RSA key pairs, encrypt and decrypt strings with public and private keys. Ideal for secure data transmission, authentication systems, and any application requiring cryptographic security.\nInstallation\nExample :npm install encrypt-rsa\n# OR\nyarn add encrypt-rsaBreaking changes (vs 3.x)\nIf you are upgrading from 3.x, this release includes breaking changes. You should bump to 4.0.0 when publishing:\n\nAsync API – All crypto methods now return Promises (sync → async). You must use await or .then().\nBefore (3.x): const encrypted = nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({ text, publicKey });\nAfter (4.x): const encrypted = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({ text, publicKey });\n\n\nEntry points – The package now has separate Node and Web builds. main/module/types point to the Node build; the browser field and conditional exports point to the Web build. If you required a specific path (e.g. encrypt-rsa/build/index.js), update to the new entry points or use the package root encrypt-rsa.\nBuffer methods – decryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey now returns Promise (type). In Node the runtime value is still a Buffer (extends Uint8Array). Prefer Uint8Array in types; avoid relying on instanceof Buffer in shared code.\n\nSee CHANGELOG.md for the full list of changes.\nNode and Web (browser)\nOne package, two environments:\n\nNode.js: Uses the built-in crypto module. All crypto methods return Promises (async API).\nBrowser: Uses the Web Crypto API. Same async API; bundlers resolve the web build via exports / browser field.\n\nYou use the same import; the correct implementation is chosen at build/runtime:\nExample :import NodeRSA from 'encrypt-rsa';\nIn Node (or when your bundler targets Node), you get the Node build.\nWhen your bundler targets the browser, you get the web build.\n\nBrowser note: In the browser build, encrypt(privateKey) and decrypt(publicKey) are not supported (Web Crypto does not support that flow) and will throw. Use encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey / decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey for encryption and decryption.\nSame interface (Node and Web)\nBoth the Node and Web builds expose the same class and method signatures (they implement the shared INodeRSA interface). You write the same code; only the resolved implementation changes:\n\nSame class: NodeRSA\nSame constructor: (publicKey?: string, privateKey?: string, modulusLength?: number)\nSame methods: encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey, decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey, encrypt, decrypt, createPrivateAndPublicKeys, encryptBufferWithRsaPublicKey, decryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey\nSame parameter and return types: All crypto methods return Promise; buffer methods use Uint8Array (in Node, Buffer extends Uint8Array so it works as well).\n\nSee docs/FEATURE_PARITY.md for a feature-by-feature comparison of Node vs Web (including the browser limitation for encrypt/decrypt with private/public key).\nUsage\nExample: Node.js\nExample :// Node (CommonJS or ESM)\nimport NodeRSA from 'encrypt-rsa';\n\nconst nodeRSA = new NodeRSA();\nconst { publicKey, privateKey } = await nodeRSA.createPrivateAndPublicKeys(2048);\n\nconst encrypted = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({\n  text: 'Secret message',\n  publicKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Encrypted:', encrypted);\n\nconst decrypted = await nodeRSA.decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey({\n  text: encrypted,\n  privateKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Decrypted:', decrypted);Example: Browser (Web)\nExample :// Browser (ESM or bundled) – same API\nimport NodeRSA from 'encrypt-rsa';\n\nconst nodeRSA = new NodeRSA();\nconst { publicKey, privateKey } = await nodeRSA.createPrivateAndPublicKeys(2048);\n\nconst encrypted = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({\n  text: 'Secret message',\n  publicKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Encrypted:', encrypted);\n\nconst decrypted = await nodeRSA.decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey({\n  text: encrypted,\n  privateKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Decrypted:', decrypted);When your bundler targets the browser, it resolves the web build; the code above is unchanged.\nCreating an instance\nExample :const nodeRSA = new NodeRSA(publicKey?, privateKey?, modulusLength?);Generating RSA key pairs\nAll crypto methods return Promises. Use await or .then():\nExample :const { publicKey, privateKey } = await nodeRSA.createPrivateAndPublicKeys(modulusLength);\nconsole.log('Public Key:', publicKey);\nconsole.log('Private Key:', privateKey);Encrypting and decrypting strings\nEncrypt with public key, decrypt with private key\nExample :const text = 'Hello, World!';\nconst encryptedString = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({ text, publicKey });\nconsole.log('Encrypted:', encryptedString);\n\nconst decryptedString = await nodeRSA.decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey({\n  text: encryptedString,\n  privateKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Decrypted:', decryptedString);Encrypt with private key, decrypt with public key (Node only)\nIn the browser build, these methods throw. In Node, they work:\nExample :const encryptedString = await nodeRSA.encrypt({ text, privateKey });\nconsole.log('Encrypted with Private Key:', encryptedString);\n\nconst decryptedString = await nodeRSA.decrypt({ text: encryptedString, publicKey });\nconsole.log('Decrypted with Public Key:', decryptedString);Buffer encryption (same interface: Uint8Array)\nBoth Node and Web use Uint8Array in the method signature. In Node, Buffer extends Uint8Array, so you can pass a Buffer as well. Return type is Promise in both environments.\nExample :// Node\nconst buffer = Buffer.from('This is some binary data');\n\n// Browser (or shared code)\nconst buffer = new TextEncoder().encode('This is some binary data');\n\nconst encryptedBuffer = await nodeRSA.encryptBufferWithRsaPublicKey(buffer, publicKey);\nconst decryptedBuffer = await nodeRSA.decryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey(\n  encryptedBuffer,\n  privateKey\n);\n\n// Node: decryptedBuffer is Buffer\n// Browser: decryptedBuffer is Uint8Array\nconsole.log(\n  decryptedBuffer instanceof Uint8Array\n    ? new TextDecoder().decode(decryptedBuffer)\n    : decryptedBuffer.toString()\n);API\nNodeRSA class\nConstructor\nExample :constructor(publicKey?: string, privateKey?: string, modulusLength?: number)\npublicKey: Optional. RSA public key (PEM).\nprivateKey: Optional. RSA private key (PEM).\nmodulusLength: Optional. Modulus length in bits (default 2048).\n\nMethods (all crypto methods return Promise)\n\n\n\nMethod\nReturns\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncreatePrivateAndPublicKeys(modulusLength?)\nPromise\nGenerate RSA key pair (PEM).\n\n\nencryptStringWithRsaPublicKey(args)\nPromise\nEncrypt with public key.\n\n\ndecryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey(args)\nPromise\nDecrypt with private key.\n\n\nencrypt(args)\nPromise\nEncrypt with private key. Node only.\n\n\ndecrypt(args)\nPromise\nDecrypt with public key. Node only.\n\n\nencryptBufferWithRsaPublicKey(buffer, publicKey?)\nPromise\nEncrypt buffer; returns base64 string.\n\n\ndecryptBufferWithRsaPrivateKey(encryptedText, privateKey?)\nPromise\nDecrypt to buffer (same type in Node and Web).\n\n\n\nParameter types\n\nparametersOfEncrypt: { text: string; publicKey?: string }\nparametersOfDecrypt: { text: string; privateKey?: string }\nparametersOfEncryptPrivate: { text: string; privateKey?: string }\nparametersOfDecryptPublic: { text: string; publicKey?: string }\nreturnCreateKeys: { publicKey: string; privateKey: string }\n\nAlgorithm and key format\n\nRSA-OAEP with SHA-1 for encrypt/decrypt with public/private key (cross-compatible between Node and browser).\nKeys are PEM (SPKI for public, PKCS#8 for private). Keys generated on one side work on the other.\n\nUse cases\nSecure data transmission\nExample :// Sender\nconst encryptedMessage = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({\n  text: 'Sensitive data',\n  publicKey: recipientPublicKey,\n});\n// Send encryptedMessage to the recipient\n\n// Recipient\nconst decryptedMessage = await nodeRSA.decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey({\n  text: encryptedMessage,\n  privateKey: recipientPrivateKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Decrypted Message:', decryptedMessage);Authentication\nExample :const encryptedCredentials = await nodeRSA.encryptStringWithRsaPublicKey({\n  text: 'username:password',\n  publicKey: serverPublicKey,\n});\n\nconst decryptedCredentials = await nodeRSA.decryptStringWithRsaPrivateKey({\n  text: encryptedCredentials,\n  privateKey: serverPrivateKey,\n});\nconsole.log('Decrypted Credentials:', decryptedCredentials);Testing\nThe project includes tests for both the Node and web builds:\n\nNode tests (tests/functionalty.node.spec.ts): Run against the Node build; cover all methods including encrypt/decrypt with private/public key and buffer operations.\nWeb tests (tests/functionalty.web.spec.ts): Run against the web build; require crypto.subtle (Node 19+ or a browser). Skipped automatically when Web Crypto is not available.\n\nExample :npm testBoth suites run with npm test. Web tests are skipped when crypto.subtle is not available (e.g. Node below 19).\nDocumentation\nAPI documentation is generated with Compodoc. To generate the docs (from the Node build source):\nExample :npm run docsGenerated files are written to the docs/ folder. To serve them locally:\nExample :npm run docs:serveThe docs reflect the NodeRSA class and its async API (Node and web share the same interface).\nReleasing\n\nChangelog from commits: Run npm run changelog to update CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits since the last tag (feat:, fix:, BREAKING CHANGE:, etc.).\nFull release: Run npm run release -- --release-as major|minor|patch to bump version, update the changelog, commit, and tag. Push to master to trigger the publish workflow (see .github/workflows/publish.yml).\n\nPublish via GitHub Actions (on merge to master):\n\nSecret: In the repo go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions and add NPM_TOKEN (npm automation token with “Publish” permission).\nTrigger: Merging (or pushing) to the master branch runs the workflow: install → test → build → publish. The JS-DevTools/npm-publish action publishes only if the version in package.json is greater than the latest on npm; otherwise the job succeeds but skips publishing.\nOptional: To make installs reproducible in CI, commit package-lock.json (remove it from .gitignore) and change the workflow step from npm install to npm ci.\n\nContribution\n\nFork the repository on GitHub.\nClone your fork: git clone git@github.com:miladezzat/encrypt-rsa.git\nCreate a branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name\nMake your changes, then commit with a clear message.\nPush to your fork and open a pull request with a description of your changes.\n\nCode of conduct\nThis project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct.
